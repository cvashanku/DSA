Introduction:
-------------
In the case of searhcing algorithms, consider the problem of searching for a value in an array. 
if the array is not sorted then we have to compare the given key value with all elements one-by-one, it will take time complexity as O(n). 
if the array is sorted then time complexity O(logn).

linear -----> O(n)
binary -----> O(logn)

It is possible to get the location of given key, by using some magic method. almost it takes O(1) constant time. 
Hash method or Hash function works just like that magic method.

Hashtable
---------
Hashtable is a data structure that maps keys to the values. Each position of the hashtable is called as slot. 
The hashtable uses hashfunction to calculate an index of an array.

the process of storing data using a hash function in a hashtable is as follows

=> create an array of size N, this array is called as hashtable.
=> find the hash code of the given data by using hash function.
=> take modulo of hash code with table size to get index of array to store the data.
=> finally store this data in the position.

the process of searching value in Hashtable using a hash function is as follows

=> find hash code of the key we are searhcing by passing that data into hash function
=> take a modulo division with hash table size
=> retrive the value from the index position which is given by hash function

we can implement the following basic operations on hashtable

1) inserting data
2) deleting data
3) searching for data
4) implementation of hash function

hash function / hash method:
----------------------------
a hash function or hash method is a function/method that generate index in a table for the given key value / object. 
an ideal hash function the generates a unquie index for every key, such type of hash functions are called as perfect hash function.
