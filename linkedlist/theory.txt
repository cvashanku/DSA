LINKED LIST DATA STRUCTURE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

the problems with arrays are:

1) size if always fixed.
2) inserting and deleting is very difficult.

to overcome these problems, we have linked list data structure.

linked list:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
it is collection of nodes which are growable. during execution we can insert and delete nodes from linked list. linked list is the best data structure for inserting and deleting elements.

accessing elements ----> best -----> arrays
insert/delete ---------> best -----> linked list

the following are the four types of linked lists are existed in java

1) single linked list
2) double linked list
3) circular single linked list
4) circular double linked list
