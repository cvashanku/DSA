if the content is fixed not changing in our program ---> String
if the content is not fixed keep on changing ----------> StringBuffer or StringBuilder

constructors:
-------------
1) StringBuffer(); it creates a new StringBuffer object with 16 as default capacity
2) StringBuffer(int); it creates a new StringBuffer object with capacity as given int
3) StringBuffer(String); it creates sb obj with given string capacity = 16 + len of str

if max capacity is readched then string buffer capacity will be automatically increased based on the following formula.

new capacity = (old capacity+1)*2
