Heap and SCP memory areas
-----------------------------
Heap:
----
=> when an object is created by using new keyword, it will be placed in side HEAP.
=> when we are performing any modifications on the str obj, with those modifications a new obj will be created in HEAP area.
=> when we are performing any modifications on the str obj, if these is content is same after modificaation, no new object will be created.

SCP:
----
=> string constant pool
=> if any str object is repeatedly required then java creates such type of objects in SCP
=> when a string literal found, that literal object will be created in SCP.
=> when we are performing any modifications on the str obj, with those modifications a new obj will be created in HEAP area but this rules is not applicable for SCP.
=> when we are performing any modifications on the str obj, if these is content is same after modificaation, no new object will be created. 

Ex1:
----
String s = new String("prakash");

heap -----> 1
scp ------> 1
total ----> 2

Ex2:
----
String s = "prakash";

heap -----> 0
scp ------> 1
total ----> 1
