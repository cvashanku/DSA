stack data structure:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
a stack is a basic data structure, it follows LIFO i.e. last-in-first-out. The item which is inserted at last will be the item removed first.

Ex:
---
	Recursion
	Stack of plats
	books in a box
	etc

the following are the common operations that we can perform on stack

push ------> add element 
pop -------> remove element
peek ------> top most element
size ------> number of elements
isempty ---> returns True if stack is empty
display ---> travese each element 
search ----> find for an object

Q) What is the difference between pop() and peek() method?
----------------------------------------------------------
pop() method will remove and return top element in the stack, but peek() method will return top element in the stack, it wn't perform delete operation.

1) Implementation of stack by using arrays
2) Implementation of stack by using linked list (SLL)
3) Implementation of stack by using predefined class (java.util.Stack)
